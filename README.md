These are just my personal notes on how to install and configure a Windows 11 PC to take full advantage of all its power, for gaming, VR, heavy workflows...

**I am not responsible for any possible damage or data loss that may occur.**

## Create Installation USB to install without TPM 2.0 requirement
- A Windows PC (Real or virtual) and a USB stick with at least 8GB capacity are required.
- Download the Windows 10 and Windows 11 media creators from [Windows Installation Media Creator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-windows-installation-media-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d)
- Use the **Windows 11** Media Creator and create an installation USB.
- Copy the `\sources\install.esd` file from the pendrive to the computer.
- Use the **Windows 10** Media Creator and create an installation USB.
- Replace the `\sources\install.esd` file on the pendrive with the one we previously copied to the computer.
- The pendrive is now ready to boot the computer from USB and install Windows.

## Create BootCamp compatible ISO for Intel Macs
- [BootCamp ISO creation utility](https://github.com/RavenSystem/BootCampW11Installer)

## Install Windows
- Boot from the USB.
  - For Intel Macs, use the BootCamp Installation Wizard with the corresponding ISO file.
- Do not enter the Windows activation key here (It is better to activate Windows once it is installed and configured, although you can leave it unactivated and everything will work without restrictions, except for the part of customizing the colors and the desktop background).
- Once installed, the initial setup wizard will run, asking for the country:
  - Press `Shift + F10` to open a Terminal.
  - To avoid the mandatory step of using a Microsoft account, run the following command (If your current keyboard layout doesn't allow you to type the `\` slash, you can copy and paste one from the Terminal itself with the mouse):
```shell
OOBE\BYPASSNRO
```
  - If the above command does not work, try the following command as an alternative:
```shell
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE" /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f shutdown /r /t 0
```
   - When the computer restarts, disconnect the network cable.
      - You can also take it offline by opening a Terminal again (`Shift + F10`) and running:
```shell
ipconfig /release
```
   - Follow the steps of the wizard, indicating that you don't have an Internet connection and creating a local user account.
   - In the questions at the end of the configuration, about permissions and data collection, always select the option not to send or share (the second of the two options).
- Once everything is finished, connect it to the Internet.
- Open Settings -> Windows Update -> Search for updates, and install them. And reboot, even if it doesn't ask for it.

This power plan maximizes your computer's power and reduces latency. Ideal for gaming, virtual reality, and real-time simulation software.
- Download the file [ravensystem_ultimate.pow](https://github.com/RavenSystem/MyWindowsNotes/raw/refs/heads/main/ravensystem_ultimate.pow).
- Open a Terminal as Administrator (Right-click on its icon and Run as administrator) and run:
```shell
powercfg -import '[complete absolut path]\ravensystem_ultimate.pow' abc00000-0000-0000-0000-000000000011
powercfg -setactive abc00000-0000-0000-0000-000000000011

      - Processor idle promote threshold: `90%`.
    - Click: OK.

## Prevent certain programs from changing the active power plan
- Some programs, such as SteamVR, change the active power plan, causing a loss of performance.
